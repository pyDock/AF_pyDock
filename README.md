## Introduction

Model Confidence and pyDock Energy are important metrics in the field of molecular docking and structural biology. Model Confidence helps in assessing the reliability of a predicted structure, while pyDock Energy evaluates the docking energy, providing insights into the stability and feasibility of the docking complex.

This notebook provides a step-by-step protocol for calculating these metrics from the outputs of pyDock, AlphaFold 2, and AlphaFold 3 using Python, with a focus on reproducibility and ease of use.

## Requirements

Before running the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- NumPy
- SciPy
- pyDock
- Matplotlib

You can install the necessary Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy scipy matplotlib jupyterlab
